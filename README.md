## Getting Started

Save the <code>youtube-new</code> directory containing the relevant <code>.csv</code> and <code>.json</code> files into the <code>data</code> directory. Then run <code>python prepare_data.py</code> to clean and feature engineer the data.

The <code>colourdata</code> directory generates a <code>colour-output.csv</code> file for use in the main insights notebook. The correct order of commands to generate this is <code>python generate_colour</code> then <code>python process_colour</code> though it is recommended that you do not run this and instead use the already generated <code>csv</code> file since doing so saves a lot of time.

There is no correct way of reading the notebooks but the main insights notebook aims at reflecting the kind of business that this project could develop into whereas the research notebooks remain rigorous.
